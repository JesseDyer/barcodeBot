Testing device for barcode scanners

I have :

*  Gen 4 Raspberry pi
*  A 2.9 inch eInk display:
  *  https://www.waveshare.com/wiki/2.9inch_e-Paper_Module
  *  https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07P6MJPTD/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o06_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1
*  An Acrylic Case for the Pi
  *  https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07T2CPC2H/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o05_s01?ie=UTF8&psc=1

.. and from this, I'm creating a device that allows me to run barcodes through that screen in order to perforem
testing of physical barcode scanners.  

The program will provide a web interface allowing the user to post the sku's to display, set how long each image 
should display, and any interval between the display of them.

It'll also take data from a raw socket to allow easy scripting.
